# Dymik Form

Dymik Form is an independent library with no UI Library as a dependency. This provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to integrate Dymik Form into any project without being tied to a specific UI Library.

However, to make the most of Dymik Form's capabilities, we recommend using it alongside PrimeVue. PrimeVue offers a powerful and easy-to-use UI toolkit, helping you build user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

Additionally, Dymik Core supports built-in components such as `div`, `span`, and more. You can also define custom components to suit your specific needs, providing even greater flexibility in building dynamic forms.
